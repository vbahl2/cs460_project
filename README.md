CS 460 Final Project by Jerry Chen and Varun Bahl


Description from Project Proposal 

For our project in the Security Lab course, we would like to pursue an application that allows us todetect/find access points for wifi (routers and whatnot). For example, IllinoisNet has many access points asgiven by how internet connection does not maintain stable connection if you are traveling on the bus throughthe campus. We are hoping to use a wifi enabled device that will collect relevant data on the wifi strengthand other data to extrapolate the possible location of the access points for the wifi as well as possibleaddresses that may be useful. If time permits, we may add features such as allowing the device to be able tochange its MAC address to stay off the grid if the MAC address becomes known.
